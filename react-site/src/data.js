You are the X-Morph - an alien species that invades Earth to harvest its resources and terraform the surface. Strategize in the build mode by carefully selecting various types of alien towers or throw yourself right into heat of the battle. Build mazes for incoming enemies in an environment that provides exceptional planning freedom. Tear down buildings and collapse bridges to support your defense or to simply indulge in a spectacle of unprecedented destruction. Possess a range of unique alien weapons and use defense strategies like you've never seen before in this genre.\n<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/408410/extras/tower_defense_header.png?t=1498551642\"></h2>\n<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/408410/extras/xmorph_maze_600x338.png?t=1498551642\"></h2>\nYour goal is to defend the X-Morph harvesters from waves of incoming human forces. Each enemy wave is preceded by a setup phase in which the player can check what types of enemies are going to be attacking him and to observe their paths. There is no time limit for this phase, so the player can carefully plan his defenses or choose to start fighting immediately and place towers when needed during the battle. One of the game's key features is the ability to build towers virtually anywhere on the map and to shape enemy paths by connecting towers with laser fences. The player can choose between building long mazes out of basic towers or placing more advanced towers which are more effective at different types of incoming enemies. Advanced tower types specialize in dealing with specific enemy types e.g. flame towers are great for destroying fast moving ground units, artillery towers are best at countering large groups of slow enemies, anti air laser is ideal for shooting down heavy bombers.\n<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/408410/extras/xmorph_shooter_600x338.png?t=1498551642\"></h2>\nAs the X-Morph fighter you can engage enemy units directly with a diverse arsenal of weapons. You can morph into four distinct forms which specialize in dealing with different kinds of threats. Each form has a basic attack and a special charged attack mode. The Plasma Fighter is the most universal form - good at destroying both air and ground units. The Dark Matter Bomber is great at decimating groups of ground units. It can also slow down time and release a dark matter bomb that can cut down buildings. The Shredder fighter is perfect for annihilating large numbers of human air units and clearing the sky. Finally the Laser Destroyer is best for smelting large single units. It can also charge up a gravitational anomaly that sucks in smaller enemy units. A large variety of weapons and enemies along with a dynamic, fully destructible environment provides a rich arcade shooter experience.\n<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/408410/extras/enviro_header.png?t=1498551642\"></h2>\n<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/408410/extras/xmorph_destruction2_600x338.png?t=1498551642\"></h2>\nThe game's environments are constructed with a lot of attention to detail and they are almost completely destructible. From small picket fences to huge skyscrapers. Any bridge or building in the game can be collapsed and it's destruction is dynamically simulated using realistic physics. The destruction is not only a visual effect as it can significantly influence the layout of the battlefield. The combination of dynamic environments, laser fences and real time calculated enemy paths creates unique gameplay scenarios.\n<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/408410/extras/mecha_header.png?t=1498551642\"></h2>\n<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/408410/extras/xmorph_mech_600x338.png?t=1498551642\"></h2>\nHumans are desperate to defend their home world. They have created huge, building size, mechanical war machines to fight against each other, but now they will use them to destroy the X-Morph. Each boss fight is unique and heavily influences the gameplay environment. Entire cities will be destroyed.\n<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/408410/extras/split_header.png?t=1498551642\"></h2>\n<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/408410/extras/xmorph_coop_600x338.png?t=1498551642\"></h2>\n<em>X-Morph: Defense</em> includes a split screen co-op mode. All missions have different gameplay scenarios designed specifically for co-op play. Enemies attack in larger numbers and from new directions making good cooperation essential to winning. In this mode the game can be played in many different ways, one player can focus on optimizing tower placement while the other shoots at enemies, or they can both focus their firepower on the strongest attackers.</div>",

Defend your idyllic island kingdom against a horde of Viking invaders, as you lead the desperate exodus of your people.

You control the broad strokes of the battle, giving high level commands to your soldiers who try their best to carry them out in the heat of the moment. It’s accessibly deep, with simple player inputs masking a dynamic combat simulation that make it inviting to new players while challenging veterans. <br><br>Keep fighting, warriors. Not for power or riches or glory, but for hope of peace to come once again in the harsh lands of the <i> Bad North</i>.<br>",

With allies to help, and an army of your own, you can defeat the invading army and make the realm safe again!</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://humblebundle-a.akamaihd.net/misc/files/hashed/f50524335b55ae9a866b8894fb1001625d8b9254.png\" width=\"580\"></p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>7 basic units, with a further 15 available as upgrades!</li>\n<li>Intriguing story with beautifully drawn artwork.</li>\n<li>3 Vastly different Classes for you to choose from: Warlord, Sorcerer, and Treasurer.

You start with a fairly empty map and a few stones where you can place defenders. As the level progresses, more stones appear and some even drop from enemies, allowing you to place them in any valid position on the map. Powerful Warstones also appear occasionally which give significant bonuses to defenders standing on them. You can summon any of the 5 basic defenders on the stones: Peasant, Archer, Rifleman, Sorceress, and Elemental. Each basic defender has its own upgrade path, damage type, gold cost, and special abilities!</p>\n<p><em>Warstone TD</em> also has 2 extra base units only available for use in attack/defense missions, the Eagle and the Wolf. Each have branching upgrade paths, like the basic defenders. With such a variety of defenders and game classes there is a huge amount of tactics in PvP battles, increasing replayability even further!</p>\n<p>There are 30 story missions and each mission has 3 modes: Campaign, Challenge, and Survival. The player can choose the difficulty of each mission from 4 settings: Easy, Normal, Hard, and Nightmare. Each mode has a unique achievement which gives a star when completed, the color of the star corresponds to the difficulty of the mission: gold for Nightmare, silver for Hard, and bronze for Normal. Levels have a lot of possible solutions but, with so many combinations, you're going to need to perfect your strategy to master them. And just in case you forget how awesome you are, there's an online leaderboard, which tracks your score, both in Campaign mode and PvP. Compete with your friends, or enemies!</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://humblebundle-a.akamaihd.net/misc/files/hashed/c114e4504ed896c0760dcb54601cc23febac8be2.gif\" width=\"580\"></p>\n<p><strong>Class system</strong><br> After you progress through the first 4 missions in the campaign, you are able to choose a class to augment your abilites in battle. The classes are non-linear, you can pick and choose skills from any class, but you have to focus on a class if you want to get the most powerful skills.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Mighty Warlord greatly increases the effectiveness of your army! He improves the power and abilities of your defenders, can unleash the power of stone to help in battle; allowing placement of stones to slow nearby enemies, or give you a surge of mana and gold. He also has skills which allow your defenders to level up in battle, becoming more powerful with each successive rank.</li>\n<li>The Cunning Treasurer's weapon is gold! He is a master of item storage, able to fit an improbably large number of items into his backpack, and find many more scrolls and even potions during battles. Everything he does is for gold! He is able to increase bounty for enemies killed, make his own defenders cheaper, and eventually can even get a powerful spell that allows you to transmute an enemy into pure gold! With all of these abilities, the Treasurer can field a much bigger army than any other class.</li>\n<li>The Powerful Sorcerer is able to complete levels using only spells! He can bring up to eight spells into battle, increasing flexibilty greatly. His skills revolve around buffing spell effectiveness, regenerating mana, unlocking more powerful spells, and he can even transform units into mana. Among the spells the sorcerer can unlock are: Summon Elemental, Reduction; which shrinks and debuffs monsters, Meteor Shower, and Teleportation; which allows you to teleport defenders to any available stone on the map.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Join the fight today, in <em>Warstone TD</em>!</p>\n<p> </p>",

The body count rises, and the police are no closer to catching the culprit. You are a taxi driver and survivor to the killer’s most recent attacks, having barely escaped with your life. You have seven nights to help find the killer, or the police will pin it on you. These next few shifts will be far from ordinary or safe… <br><br><i>Night Call</i> is a non-linear, narrative-driven noire investigation game. You are no detective, but you do have a gift. Around you, people feel more at ease. They talk. They share their thoughts, their emotions, their stories… their <i> secrets. </i> To passengers, you are more than just a driver; you are also a friend, a confidant, a shrink. A voyeur catching a glimpse under the masked but very real lives throughout the City of Light. And you’ll need to play these roles well if you want to catch the killer. <br><br>Use the limited time you have available each night to gather clues while earning money to pay your bills. Drive passengers to their destinations, hear their stories and choose your responses carefully—some are just regular people with a tale to tell, while others might reveal a clue that’s key to your investigation. Follow the right leads to uncover new info about the suspects, and don’t forget to make enough money to buy gas and pay your bills. <br><br>Can you solve the mystery before it’s too late?

Your character leaves footprints, which can be used to track your way back or notice paths already visited without opening the map. <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>Challenging Endgame </strong> <br><img height=\"200\" src=\"https://hb.imgix.net/4bd88e83bbc248deefddbb03c2e4aba8ae734c6c.png?auto=compress,format&amp;s=c766d960e719cb1360fded924a1687e4\" width=\"600\"> <br>On average it takes about 10 hours to complete the campaign with a single class, but maxing out a character and mastering all of the higher Freeplay difficulty levels and Quests takes much longer. The Roguelike mode offers another level of challenge with permadeath, restricted healing and even more obstacles to overcome. <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br><br></strong>",

COLDER.&nbsp;</h1>\nSince the release, <i>Frostpunk</i> has become more complex, deeper and even more stunning than ever before - thanks to all the free updates that were delivered, based on our Development Roadmap. <br><br>Experience the unmatched society survival game once more, now enchanced with The Fall of Winterhome story scenario, new difficulty settings, more customization options and - most importantly - Endless Mode with its unique maps, mechanics and buildings. <br><br><strong> Learn more about all the updates: </strong><br>\n<ul>\n<li>Endless Mode</li>\n<li>The Fall of Winterhome&nbsp;scenario</li>\n<li>Survivor Mode</li>\n<li>People &amp; Automatons</li>\n<li>Winter Snapshots</li>\n</ul>\n<br>However, that is not our last word.

In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive. <br><br>Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state. <br><br>What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process? <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>MAKE THE LAW </strong> <br>Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. <br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/323190/extras/FP_STEAM_GIF_01.gif?t=1566921307\"> <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY </strong> <br>If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: there’s no turning back. <br><video autoplay=\"autoplay\" loop=\"loop\" muted=\"muted\" preload=\"auto\" style=\"width: 620px; height: auto;\">\n   <source src=\"https://hb.imgix.net/c11ebbe8781d3eb958699d38a0da544d067eeddb.gif?auto=format&amp;fm=mp4&amp;s=91d2a636528ecf94ab317bb0183bb8fc\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n   \n  </video> <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>WEIGH UP YOUR CHOICES </strong> <br>Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results.

It's also \"a sequel to [Arcen's] enormo-space RTS AI War, which we called\n  <strong>\n   'one of this year's finest strategy games'\n  </strong>\n  back in 2009\" (Tom Sykes, PC Gamer)\n  <strong class=\"hmb\">\n   <br>\n   <br>\n   The most devious and acclaimed artificial intelligence in strategy gaming returns... with a host of mutual enemies.\n  </strong>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  Face off against a more advanced version of the original AI, who once again has captured the entire galaxy leaving you only a tiny planet to yourself. Then strike out and find a way to cleverly outwit it nonetheless. All the new capturables, larger fleets, and hacking abilities are sure to help. (You're going to need it.)\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  Or immerse yourself in a far more complicated galactic struggle involving the nanocaust, macrophages, dyson spheres, and more. Other factions each have their own goals, rules, units, and entirely unique economies. Make the scenario complicated enough and it can become \"World War XV is in progress, you're in a tiny farm in the middle of it, nobody likes you, but if you can just kill that one giant angry enemy leader this will all be over.\"\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  If that sounds over the top -- and frankly that bit is wearying to us to imagine even though some people seek it out -- then take a break and maybe hack the all-consuming computer virus to be your ally, and convince the star-sized alien hives to watch your back as you take on a suddenly-less-arrogant AI.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>\n   (If you're really feeling spiteful, take yourself out of the equation, turn on super fast forward, and watch them all fight like ants on a galactic scale.)\n  </i>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <video autoplay=\"autoplay\" loop=\"loop\" muted=\"muted\" preload=\"auto\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 299px;\">\n   <source src=\"https://hb.imgix.net/2587c4e8af2e137840b70304fb059de79e27e647.gif?auto=format&fm=mp4&s=7a313108818233acc7d57d19e8817ef6\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n   </source>\n  </video>\n  <strong class=\"hmb\">\n   <br>\n   <br>\n   Modernized and supercharged.\n  </strong>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  It's been ten years since the original AI War launched, and the gaming world has changed a lot -- as has the available computing power on any device you're using to read this. We've pulled out all the stops to build foes more formidable and intelligent than before, and to create simulations of hundreds of thousands of units running at 120fps in a lot of cases. You can speed up and slow down the simulation without any extra load on your CPU, and pause at will.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  The interface respects your time by automating things that you would do the same 95% of the time anyway. For that other 5% there are indeed advanced features such as placing spy nanites, tweaking or disabling the rules of automation, or redesigning your fleet compositions as much as you want.\n  <strong class=\"hmb\">\n   <br>\n   <br>\n   Streamlined, yet deeper.\n  </strong>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  Sometimes when a sequel says it's \"streamlined,\" it can really mean \"dumbed down.\" And there are indeed fewer tiny choices to be made in some areas here: you don't have to decide how to wash each dish; you have a dishwasher. And it's a good thing you do, to be honest, because the rabbit hole of complex and confounding scenarios goes as deep as you want it to.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  All those bits where you make the interesting strategic decisions? Those bits are tougher than ever, and you can't fall back on old boring habits to muddle through. You need your attention free to anticipate, to plan, to dream... and then throw those all aside and figure it out by the seat of your pants when everything goes sideways.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  There's too much to memorize (but tooltips are always right there, anyway), and there's always an unfamiliar element.  Clicking fast won't help you. To win the AI War, you'll have to improvise, adapt, and use your wits.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  As it should be.\n  <strong class=\"hmb\">\n   <br>\n   <br>\n   How About Some Highlights?\n  </strong>\n  <br>\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    Many optional factions, each with their own goals and strategies, create a living galaxy.\n    <br>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    A new Fleets system gives you even more ships than before, and allows you to customize your empire more than ever.\n    <br>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    A ton of map types, and with a lot of sub-options to make them even more varied.\n    <br>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    Outguard to hire, factions to ally with, and oodles of targets to capture or hack --with the AI or aliens.\n    <br>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    Warden, Hunter, and Praetorian Guard sub-fleets of the AI provide for new challenges (and sometimes opportunities) in how both you and the AI interact with each other.\n    <br>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    Crazy moddability, with many levers available in easily-accessible XML.\n   </li>\n  </ul>\n  <strong class=\"hmb\">\n   <br>\n   <br>\n   What's New Compared To The Original?\n  </strong>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    More approachable gameplay, but with a rabbit hole that goes as deep as ever.\n    <br>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    More to do, in terms of moment to moment gameplay and choices.

Truber-what? No idea! It doesn’t help he can’t remember taking part in any lottery in the first place … Happy to put some distance between him and his Ph.D. in quantum physics, he makes his way to Trüberbrook, Germany, bursting with curiosity.<br/><br/>But shortly after his arrival, inexplicable things start to happen: A mysterious stranger breaks into his room at the Guesthouse Waldeslust and steals a paper on physics. But who would do that? And why?<br/><br/>Gradually, he gets to know the various villagers and spa guests, one more peculiar than the other. Only young anthropologist Greta Lemke, who is on a research trip to Trüberbrook, seems normal to him.

The puzzles are designed to integrate into the narrative.<br/><br/><video preload=\"auto\" autoplay=\"autoplay\" muted=\"muted\" loop=\"loop\" style=\"width: 616px; height: 272px;\">\n  <source src=\"https://hb.imgix.net/cb5d2e8ca239fa06905b2108af684643c280bd35.gif?auto=format&fm=mp4&s=f2afea2bba04b84d269574628d4a783a\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video><br/><br/>You navigate Tannhauser through the different sceneries from a third person perspective, usually in long distance shots to intensify the impression of peeking into a little diorama.

Inspirations come from the works of <i>Tom Waits</i>, <i>Angelo Badalamenti</i>, <i>Mark Lanegan</i>, <i>Timber Timbre</i> or <i>Bohren &amp; der Club of Gore</i>. The soundtrack is directed by Sebastian Nagel &amp; Albrecht Schrader.<br/><br/><img src=\"https://hb.imgix.net/8b3745a13e8718d81e1701e14508fcf67f7d7aec.png?auto=compress,format&s=a49d8bd34070e798ac4b17a65f62eaf1\" width=\"616\" height=\"78\"><br/><br/>We've spent a lot of time working on a voice acting concept that joins in with the genetic code of the game. Since the protagonist is an American in the midst of a bunch of Germans, we wanted to reflect this in our choice of actors: In the international English audio, the main character Tannhauser speaks native American English, while all of the townspeople of Trüberbrook sport genuine German accents!</body></html>",

Create your own character based on 1920's archetypes and carve a path through a broken and mysterious world.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  Your desperate battle against forces beyond comprehension will haunt you until the end. Physical combat will be challenging, spellcasting will have dire consequences, and your sanity will be strained to the breaking point by unknown abominations. Sometimes the best solution will be to flee what lurks beyond the threshold.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <video autoplay loop=\"loop\" muted=\"muted\" preload=\"auto\" style=\"\">\n   <source src=\"https://hb.imgix.net/f203deebb767fe23534ada044a92044025406236.gif?auto=format&amp;fm=mp4&amp;s=2b7552f8382cade815032321b3b0fd46\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n   \n  </video>\n  <br>\n  <strong>\n   <br>\n   Features:\n  </strong>\n  <br>\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    A hand drawn 2D world reflecting Lovecraft's themes of cosmic horror and dread.\n    <br>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    Enemies, environments and storylines inspired by Lovecraft’s iconic original works. Take part in quests inspired by your favorite stories and see them play out according to your own decisions and role-playing style.\n    <br>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    Choose from 8 main character Archetypes, each with its own origin backstory and specialties.\n    <br>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    A host of weird companions will accompany you on your ill-starred journey: the lonely, antediluvian 'Outsider', a fallen soldier of the Great War reanimated by Herbert West. Recruit these and other outlandish beings to your crew.\n    <br>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    Your character's Sanity and mental state will influence dialogue options. Mental illness comes with advantages as well as hindrances. Sometimes it pays to be mad in a world gone mad!\n    <br>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    Stygian's Belief System determines how your characters cope with the warped reality of the new Arkham, as well as the rate at which they regenerate lost Sanity. Belief Systems also offer unique dialogue options, expanding the breadth of role-playing possibilities.\n    <br>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    A new kind of spell system which sometimes takes more than it gives. Being a master of the occult is not as simple as flinging colored missiles from your fingertips. The black magic of Stygian is potent but may cost you your mind, your health, and possibly even much more.\n    <br>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    Strategic, turn-based combat from a 2D perspective, similar to the classic Heroes of Might and Magic games.\n    <br>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    The struggle in Stygian is not to save the world, for that battle is lost already. Pursue your own goals in these end times: salvation, vendetta, or perhaps something darker.\n   </li>\n  </ul>\n \n",

Many themes have emerged in the cultural identity of Death, including\n<i>\n The Dance of Death\n</i>\nor\n<i>\n Danse Macabre\n</i>\nand\n<i>\n Death And The Maiden\n</i>\n. We sort of mashed those two themes together in <i>Felix The Reaper</i>.\n<br>\n<br>\nFor the character himself and the world around him, the inspiration was more diverse: We took cues from the ancient TV show\n<i>\n The Twilight Zon\n</i>\ne, medieval painters like\n<i>\n Bruegel and Bosch\n</i>\nand the cartoon characters of\n<i>\n Adventure Time\n</i>\nand\n<i>\n Hayao Miyazaki\n</i>\n.\n<br>\n<br>\nAnother important inspiration for <i>Felix The Reaper</i> was the amazing artistic collaborators in the production. We worked with dancers, a long list of music artists and history scholars.\n<strong>\n <br>\n <br>\n The Dance\n</strong>\n<br>\nSeveral dancers contributed to the game's production, and eventually Gunilla Lind and Raphaël Ferdinand Eder-Kastling improvised the final moves that ended up in the game.\n<br>\n<br>\nHere's Gunilla doing a dance move for Felix:\n<br>\n<video autoplay loop=\"loop\" muted=\"muted\" preload=\"auto\" style=\"\">\n <source src=\"https://hb.imgix.net/a6037cc33ad5a65b7249689e83f388cc63492953.gif?auto=format&amp;fm=mp4&amp;s=cbaa3e9b4c39637cd694ed59dadc8d44\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n<br>\nAnd here's Raphael doing another:\n<br>\n<video autoplay loop=\"loop\" muted=\"muted\" preload=\"auto\" style=\"\">\n <source src=\"https://hb.imgix.net/b4138a75d7ffaf540a39402cdf086d21c0d57de0.gif?auto=format&amp;fm=mp4&amp;s=6f3ce08b8884cc738fe5ab18682f058c\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n<strong>\n <br>\n <br>\n The Music\n</strong>\n<br>\nOf course a game with a dancing protagonist needs great music—why else would he be dancing? We designed the game in a way that lets the music artists be themselves. We wanted them to add to the game through their personal artistic expression, rather than ask them to be what we want them to be. This made for a varied and strange combination of music. But since the gameplay is a non-stressful puzzler, you actually have time to appreciate and enjoy the weirdness while playing.\n<strong>\n <br>\n <br>\n The Art History\n</strong>\n<br>\nThe idea for the game itself stems from art history. We actually started with\n<i>\n The Danse Macabre\n</i>\nand\n<i>\n Death and The Maiden\n</i>\nas a basis, and then asked ourselves: How can we make a game about this? Eventually and through several different prototypes, we ended up here.\n<br>\n<br>\nAlongside the production, a history scholar was diving into the art history of Death across more than 10 centuries for a book manuscript he is working on, and every time he hit upon something interesting he told us, and we tried to put it into the game if it fit. There are five different articles by this historian\n<i>\n Søren Hein Rasmussen\n</i>\nwithin the game—you can unlock them as you progress.\n",

Everything is already dead or dying... except you. Or so you think. Don't Escape: 4 Days to survive is a post-apocalyptic thriller from veteran developer Scriptwelder, creator of the popular horror series Deep Sleep and Don't Escape. Players must figure out a way to properly fortify their home against each night's new danger, as they learn the truth behind the apocalypse and search for a way to safety, if one exists.<br><br><img alt=\"\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://files.armorgames.com/misc/5sZGzm9AQKimkG2YYzUH_spider_gif.gif\" width=\"600\"><br><br>Players will journey alongside David, a lone survivor after the end of the world, who finds himself having prophetic dreams... or nightmares. Each chapter of the game has multiple potential variations to encounter, from poisonous fog or spiders to a gang of murderous thugs or a deadly heat wave, and as a result, you'll need to adjust your strategy on different playthroughs. But you don't have forever. Certain actions advance the in-game clock, and you'll need to complete your preparations to (hopefully) stay alive before night falls. <br><br>Will you make it through all four days? Will your companions?<br><br><img alt=\"\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://files.armorgames.com/misc/0WllFDLkQkWt2kaA8bIt_thugs_gif.gif\" width=\"600\"><br><br>Features:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>A classic pixelart aesthetic and creepy atmosphere from a veteran of horror and thrillers.</li>\n<li>Logical puzzles and exploration to challenge players without frustrating them.</li>\n<li>Time mechanics; certain actions advance the clock in a race against time.</li>\n<li>A post-apocalyptic thriller, with an engaging storyline and cast.</li>\n<li>Moody and engrossing original musicial score.</li>\n<li>Multiple variations for each chapter mean multiple playthroughs with new content.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>About the Developer:<br>Poland-based developer Scriptwelder is a well known creator of creepy web-based games, perhaps the most iconic of which is the Deep Sleep series, which has won multiple awards and been played by millions all around the world. The Don't Escape series began as a web game that inverted the classic escape-the-room formula... rather than trying to find a way out, players were instead trying to find a way to secure themselves within, usually from some sort of threat or danger. Don't Escape: 4 Days to Survive is his first full length premium game.",

But every strike speeds up the ball or even doubles its speed, up to shatteringly extreme velocities. You can tag the ball to your color, but on those high speeds the tables are quickly turned.

You will perform tasks that will put test your humanity and take part in a complex and often brutal struggle for power between the Camarilla and the Anarchs. You’ll interact with key NPCs - form unique bonds and relations and learn your undead companions’ deepest secrets... or see them abandon you. You’ll feast on the living and will ask yourself about the very nature of humanity. You will have to keep track of your Hunger or the Beast inside you will take over. You will make choices for the character, including which storylines to pursue and how to approach the different situations presented. You will take part in a narrative experience with branching dialogue choices, memorable characters - all among iconic locales of the Big Apple. You will be able to use Disciplines that will help you in combat and conversations, but be aware that every use of a Discipline may increase the level of your Hunger.

It was a fruitful journey thus far - but more lays ahead of us! <br><strong> Here's the current state of our journey along the Development Roadmap: </strong> <br>1. Free Update #1: Shrine of Challenge - <strong> Visited on Feb 2nd, 2020. </strong> <br>2. Free Update #2: Setting Sun Inn - <strong> Visited on May 7th, 2020. </strong> <br>3. Free Update #3: Bergsons' House - <strong> Visited on June 24th, 2020. </strong> <br>4. Free Update #4: A Treasure! + Random Encounter Update (it's still a secret!) <br>5. Free Update #5: Temple of The Endless <br>6. Free Update #6: The Fellowship Sanctuary <br>7. Paid DLC Update. <br><br>As you've noticed by now, even with a map in hand, sometimes we have to take detours and diverge from our original path. \"Not all those who wander are lost\", however. <strong> We absolutely still plan to deliver all the promised content, we just had to change the order of the updates and merge one with another. </strong> <br><br><strong> About the game: </strong> <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY </strong> <br><br><i>Children of Morta</i> is an action RPG with a rogue-lite approach to character development, where you don’t play a single character - but a whole, extraordinary family of heroes. Hack’n’slash through hordes of enemies in procedurally generated dungeons, caves and lands and lead the family of Bergsons, with all their flaws and virtues, against the forthcoming Corruption. <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>FEATURES: </strong> <br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/330020/extras/1_Features.gif?t=1593002168\"> <br><strong> GAMEPLAY </strong> <br>Gameplay-wise it's a unique mix of action-adventure RPG, rogue-lite and hack and slash game. By leveling up, you develop not only individual characters but also the entire family. There is no permadeath and you can change family members between the dungeon runs. <br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/330020/extras/2_Story.gif?t=1593002168\"> <br><strong> STORY </strong> <br>The story takes place in a distant land but copes with themes and emotions common to all of us: love and hope, longing and uncertainty, ultimately loss... and sacrifice we are willing to make to save the ones we care the most for. Ultimately, it's about a family of heroes standing against the encroaching darkness. <br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/330020/extras/4_DungeonCrawling.gif?t=1593002168\"> <br><strong> DUNGEON CRAWLING </strong> <br>All the dungeons in the game are procedurally generated, which means their layout is different with each adventure. There can be from two to four levels of each dungeon, with a unique boss fight at the end. You can always get back to the previous dungeons to get extra XP or finish all the side quests. <br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/330020/extras/5_Characters.gif?t=1593002168\"> <br><strong> CHARACTERS &amp; SKILLS </strong> <br>Ranged attacks, magic spells, blocks, stuns, healing, evasions and passive skills - it's all there for you to discover, unlock and upgrade. You can choose from seven different family members, each one having unique skill sets. The father, John - a protective warrior with a sword and shield. The elder daughter Linda - a precise archer. Kevin, a quiet fighter equipped with deadly daggers. Lucy - a lively and bold fire mage. Mark - a mindful martial arts fighter. Joey - who smashes his enemies with a sledgehammer. And the latest addition to the family - Apan, a mighty healer and a firm defender in one. <br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/330020/extras/6_Artstyle.gif?t=1593002168\"> <br><strong> ART STYLE </strong> <br>A combination of hand-painted pixel art and frame-by-frame animations partnered with modern lighting techniques come to life to create the beautifully dangerous world of <i>Children of Morta</i>!",

        "description": "<html>\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  You’re a nobody. An outcast in your own vampiric sect. A political prisoner of no particular value. An immigrant who never found her roots in a city of immigrants. A chainsmoker whose favorite pastime is staring blankly at the streets through the windows of a fast food joint at 4AM. The sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach tells you that you’re doomed, and distorted voices from the shadows seem to agree. The curse of your clan makes interacting with everyday technology difficult. Dissociation is your natural state.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  But when New York’s Anarch leader meets a gruesome end, out of all the bloodsuckers in the metropolis, you’re the one picked to investigate. Make no mistake: this is obviously a trap, yet another move in the horrible game of Jyhad, the eternal struggle for power between warring vampire generations. But you’re Lasombra, and if there’s one thing you know, it’s this: if the Ventrue Prince and her followers underestimate you, they’re going to deeply regret it.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>\n   Vampire: The Masquerade – Shadows of New York\n  </strong>\n  is a visual novel set in the rich universe of Vampire: The Masquerade. It acts as a stand-alone expansion and a companion piece to our previous title, Coteries of New York. While Coteries was a general introduction to the world depicted in the 5th Edition of the hit tabletop role-playing game, Shadows presents a more personal and unique tale.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    A visual novel tackling themes of personal and political horror, suitable for both Vampire: The Masquerade veterans, and fans of narrative-driven games who are newcomers to the setting.\n    <br>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    A stand-alone expansion to Coteries of New York. See the familiar metropolis through entirely different eyes. Expect new characters, new locations and a fresh original soundtrack.\n    <br>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    Play as a member of the Lasombra clan. Formerly vicious foes of the Camarilla, the Magisters decided to search for safety in the ranks of their former enemies. Master the shadows and communicate with the inhabitants of the Other Side, but beware – Oblivion is always lurking out there, ready to devour you whole.\n    <br>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    Explore the streets of the Big Apple. While you search for ways to satiate your bloodthirst, catch glimpses of various fascinating vignettes and forge connections with the eccentric inhabitants of the city. One playthrough won’t be enough to see it all.\n    <br>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    Shape your mind, shape your fate. You used to avoid defining yourself and tried to stay neutral, but given your situation, you can no longer afford to do so. The choices you make will alter the way you think, and your thinking will alter the paths you take.\n   </li>\n  </ul>\n  <strong class=\"hmb\">\n   <br>\n   <br>\n   If it’s called Vampire: The Masquerade, does that mean you have something in common with World of Darkness, Bloodlines 2, Redemption, the cult tabletop RPG system, or...?\n  </strong>\n  <br>\n  Yes. Shadows of New York is set in the same shared universe, but offers stand-alone experiences and stories. You may spot some connections with the other titles, but Shadows is not a sequel to any existing products. The World of Darkness is a media franchise and shared universe, shaped by various creators and participants, meaning: all stand-alone stories play into a greater whole. Berlin falling to the Anarchs during an official LARP, the Lasombra clan joining forces with the Camarilla in the Vampire: The Masquerade - Chicago By Night 5th Edition sourcebook, Sophie Langley’s plot to take control of New York in Coteries of New York – all of these events subtly influence and interact with each other.\n  <strong class=\"hmb\">\n   <br>\n   <br>\n   Do I need to play Coteries of New York to understand and enjoy the story of Shadows of New York?\n  </strong>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  Not at all. Shadows of New York is a stand-alone expansion to Coteries of New York, which means it shares the New York City setting and a large part of the supporting cast with our previous title, but is designed to offer a different experience. Coteries served as an introduction to the basics of Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition – it was focused on showcasing different vampire Clans and core concepts of the setting through the point of view of a newly-fledged vampire, a character who did have a defined backstory, but by and large meant to serve as a player avatar.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  Shadows of New York is a more personal story, told from the perspective of a well-defined character who’s already integrated into the Kindred society and has a developed inner monologue of her own (which means you influence her personality instead of shaping it). Those who are familiar with Coteries will already know a large part of the cast and catch some references that would otherwise go unnoticed, but those who decide to start with Shadows and get back to Coteries later should be able to enjoy both experiences just as much as they would if they played them in their release order. The two stories are essentially separate, different both tonally and thematically.\n  <strong class=\"hmb\">\n   <br>\n   <br>\n   Which platforms will Shadows of New York be available on? Will there be a simultaneous release date?\n  </strong>\n  <br>\n  Shadows of New York will launch simultaneously on PC (Windows/Mac OS/Linux), PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch in 2020.\n  <strong class=\"hmb\">\n   <br>\n   <br>\n   Does the game support controllers?\n  </strong>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  Yes. You’ll be able to play both with mouse and keyboard, as well as with a controller.\n </body>\n</html>",

I’m rdein, the creator and director of <i>Minoria</i>.\n  <br>\n  First of all, I’d like to share my excitement in announcing this project. This is a universe I care a lot for, from the setting to the characters, and it’s been a lot of fun to explore and develop its concepts during the process of game development.\n  <br>\n  For the first time in many years, I started a game project set in a new universe. It felt like a breath of fresh air for me. With that said, <i>Minoria</i> does contain some similarities with my previous projects (especially Momodora’s latest installment, Reverie Under the Moonlight).\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  I am proud of what we’ve been making for <i>Minoria</i>, and I hope you will enjoy the story and characters I’ve prepared this time around!\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <video autoplay=\"autoplay\" loop=\"loop\" muted=\"muted\" preload=\"auto\" style=\"width: 480px; height: 270px;\">\n   <source src=\"https://hb.imgix.net/5867db43fed5b06f89d2d9863836b3693a55cf79.gif?auto=format&fm=mp4&s=f9da8d90ad2701884ad9744c85f4d307\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n   </source>\n  </video>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <img height=\"119\" src=\"https://hb.imgix.net/d018a69802e432a3f55167218aee20292531fbc3.png?auto=compress,format&s=8d962b6ffb78b9faef11eca696761539\" width=\"595\">\n  <br>\n  Howdy folks, Dan here from Dangen Entertainment. It’s been hard patiently waiting for the announcement of <i>Minoria</i>, knowing what an amazing game it’s going to be. It combines everything I love about the Momodora games with stronger emphasis on a solemn story. I love how Bombservice is approaching the visuals this time around too--it’s a unique take that looks beautiful and shows another evolutionary step in the team’s development experience, just as previous titles have.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  This game is extraordinary.

The Professor is a specialist in ranged combat, with less Health and a special shield granted by his weapon, the Tillinghast. The Witch does a lot of damage, has teleport abilities and elemental shields of fire and ice, but also a very low Health. The Thief is a specialist in melée combat that takes advantage of its stealth to maximize her damage.

Explore a variety of biomes, from the lush wetlands environment to the much less habitable desert and arctic.<br><br><strong> MEET THE LOCALS: </strong> Encounter a variety of alien life forms, including giant sandworms, deadly plague spores, and a vicious fungal infection known as “The Creep.”<br><br><strong> SUPERVISE YOUR COLONISTS: </strong> Settling a new world can be stressful. As a new Colony Governor, you’ll need to work overtime to help your colonists deal with their new environment.

Earn the respect of your colonists, and rise in rank from Colony Governor to Expedition President!<br><br><strong> DISCOVER THE PAST: </strong> The world of Aven Prime holds many secrets. Play through a full single-player campaign and participate in a story that reveals some of the many secrets of this brave new world.<br><br><strong> BUILD THE FUTURE: </strong> Use construction drones to build dozens of types of structures to house your colonists, establish trading routes, welcome immigrants and much more!

Explore a new land, research technology, conquer your enemies, and go head-to-head with history's most renowned leaders as you attempt to build the greatest civilization the world has ever known.<br><br>Civilization VI offers new ways to engage with your world: cities now physically expand across the map, active research in technology and culture unlocks new potential, and competing leaders will pursue their own agendas based on their historical traits as you race for one of five ways to achieve victory in the game. <br><br>Sid Meier's Civilization VI: Platinum Edition is the perfect entry point for PC gamers who have yet to experience the addictive gameplay that has made Civilization one of the greatest game series of all time. The package includes Sid Meier's Civilization VI, six DLC packs as well as the Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm expansions.<br><br><strong>Platinum Edition Contents:</strong> <br>\n<ul>\n<li>Sid Meier's Civilization VI</li>\n<li>Civilization VI: Vikings Scenario Pack</li>\n<li>Civilization VI: Poland Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack</li>\n<li>Civilization VI: Australia Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack</li>\n<li>Civilization VI: Persia and Macedon Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack</li>\n<li>Civilization VI: Nubia Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack</li>\n<li>Civilization VI: Khmer and Indonesia Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack</li>\n<li>Civilization VI: Rise and Fall expansion</li>\n<li>Civilization VI: Gathering Storm expansion</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>THE WORLD'S GREATEST LEADERS:</strong> Play as one of 45 different leaders from various civilizations around the world and throughout history. Build an empire of lucrative trade routes with Cleopatra of Egypt, flex the military might of your legions with Trajan of Rome, or develop a powerhouse of culture with Hojo Tokimune of Japan. Each of the leaders can be played any way you prefer, with unique abilities, units, and infrastructure in their quest for victory.<br><br><strong>EXPANSIVE EMPIRES:</strong> See the marvels of your empire spread across the map like never before. Each city spans multiple tiles so you can custom build your cities to take full advantage of the local terrain.<br><br><strong>ACTIVE RESEARCH:</strong> Unlock boosts that speed your civilization's progress through history. To advance more quickly, use your units to actively explore, develop your environment, and discover new cultures. <br><br><strong>DYNAMIC DIPLOMACY:</strong> Interactions with other civilizations change over the course of the game, from primitive first interactions where conflict is a fact of life, to late game alliances and negotiations. <br><br><strong>GREAT AGES:</strong> As your civilization ebbs and flows, and you reach milestone Historic Moments, you will move towards Dark Ages or Golden Ages, each providing specific challenges or bonuses based on your actions in game. Rise triumphantly from a Dark Age, and your next Golden Age will be even stronger: a Heroic Age.<br><br><strong>LOYALTY:</strong> Cities now have individual Loyalty to your leadership: let it fall too low, and face the consequences of low yields, revolts, and the potential to lose your city if it declares its own independence. But one civilization's loss can be your gain as you inspire Loyalty among cities throughout the map and further expand your borders. <br><br><strong>GOVERNORS:</strong> Recruit, appoint, and upgrade powerful characters with unique specialization bonuses and promotion trees to customize your cities, and reinforce Loyalty.<br><br><strong>COMBINED ARMS:</strong> Expanding on the \"one unit per tile\" design, support units can now be embedded with other units, like anti-tank support with infantry, or a warrior with settlers. Similar units can also be combined to form powerful \"Corps\" units.<br><br><strong>EMERGENCIES:</strong> When a civilization grows too powerful, other civilizations can join a pact against the threatening civilization, and earn rewards, or penalties, when the Emergency ends.<br><br><strong>TIMELINE:</strong> Review your civilization's history at any time with the new Timeline feature, a visual journey through the Historic Moments that you encountered on your path to victory. <br><br><strong>ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS:</strong> Volcanoes, storms (blizzards, sandstorms, tornados, hurricanes), climate change, floods, and droughts bring the world to life in a brand-new way. Your settlement choices are more important than ever as you balance high risks and high rewards. <br><br><strong>POWER AND CONSUMABLE RESOURCES:</strong> Strategic resources play an additional role. These resources are now consumed in power plants to generate electricity for your cities. Initially you'll be powering your most advanced buildings by burning carbon-based resources like Coal and Oil, but renewable energy sources also unlock as you progress to current-day technologies. Your choices about resource usage will directly affect the world's temperature and can cause melting ice caps and rising sea levels. <br><br><strong>ENGINEERING PROJECTS:</strong> Shape the world around your empire to overcome unfavorable land conditions by making improvements like canals, dams, tunnels and railroads. When settling cities, consider the flood risk to coastal lowland areas, but keep in mind that in the late-game, new technologies like Flood Barriers can be used to protect these tiles.<br><br><strong>WORLD CONGRESS:</strong> Make your voice heard among the other leaders of the world. Earn Diplomatic Favor through Alliances, influencing city-states, competing in World Games, and more. Use Diplomatic Favor to extract promises from other leaders, vote on Resolutions, call a Special Session to address an emergency, and increase the weight of your votes in your quest to achieve the new Diplomatic Victory. <br><br><strong>21st CENTURY TECHNOLOGIES &amp; CIVICS:</strong> A new era has been added to the Technology and Civics trees. Combat new environmental effects with speculative ideas such as relocating your population out to seasteads and developing technologies to recapture carbon emissions.<br><br><strong>ENHANCED MULTIPLAYER:</strong> In addition to traditional multiplayer modes, cooperate and compete with your friends in a wide variety of situations all designed to be easily completed in a single session.",

The player can equip and use any weapon dropped by defeated enemies, attack or block, aim high or low, use weapons advantageously through a rock-paper-scissors style weapon type system, and cast spells by breaking weapons. Weapons abound in levels, so the player is encouraged to use them profusely.

Upon impact, each of the weapons opened a breach in the fabric of reality and unleashed legions of colossal demons.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  In anticipation of such unforeseen Earth-threatening events, the International Security Council formed Gauntlet, a science committee developing super-sophisticated defense technologies. Gauntlet discovers that denizens of the Netherworld can only be defeated by their own weapons.

Your arsenal consists of useful gadgets such as bear traps, a secret control room, smoke bombs, and more.

        "description": "<strong class=\"hmb\">\n <br>\n <br>\n ABOUT ADOM\n</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\n ADOM (Ancient Domains Of Mystery)\n</strong>\nis one of the most successful roguelike games ever created, boasting a brilliant mix of story, RPG, exploration, and intensely strategic and flexible combat. The Steam version adds various Deluxe features like achievements, difficulty level customization and various play modes (e.g. a story mode allowing to save and restore games, a weekly challenge game, an exploration mode and more). ADOM has been in development since 1994. In 2012 its development was revitalized with an immensely successful crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, now allowing us to offer ADOM both with ASCII and graphical modes enabling you to choose freely.\n<br>\n<br>\nADOM is primarily known for being the first roguelike to include vibrant towns, NPC dialog, and quests, but it offers more than just a rich story line in a complex fantasy world:\n<br>\n<ul>\n <li>\n  a huge game world with hundreds of locations such as towns, randomized dungeons, elemental temples, graveyards, ancient ruins, towers and other secrets\n  <br>\n </li>\n <li>\n  loads of races (dwarves, drakelings, mist elves, hurthlings, orcs, trolls, ratlings and many others) and even more classes (fighters, elementalists, assassins, chaos knights, duelists and much more) allowing for infinite play styles\n  <br>\n </li>\n <li>\n  hundreds of monsters and items, many with enhanced random features\n  <br>\n </li>\n <li>\n  a corruption system forcing you to balance lust for power with fear of damnation (corruptions slowly transform you into a vile monster but at the same time grant inhuman benefits - most of the time)\n  <br>\n </li>\n <li>\n  spells, prayers, mindcraft, alchemy, crafting and more\n  <br>\n </li>\n <li>\n  dozens of quests and branching story lines\n  <br>\n </li>\n <li>\n  numerous wildly different endings that might alter reality itself (simply drive Chaos away or slay a god or even become an immortal yourself, and others more)!\n  <br>\n </li>\n <li>\n  various game modes (story mode to be able to load and save games, challenge mode to face peculiar weekly challenges, exploration mode for a free wand of wishing and more)\n  <br>\n </li>\n <li>\n  various customization options (turning hunger off, turning corruption off, modifying monster difficulty or treasure rates)\n </li>\n</ul>\n<strong class=\"hmb\">\n <br>\n <br>\n ABOUT THE ANCIENT DOMAINS OF MYSTERY\n</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nDeep in the mountainous ranges of the Drakalor Chain, Chaos has broken through into Ancardia and it's up to you to decide the fate of the entire realm. You control a single character with a wildy varying set of skills, talents, spells and other abilities. Customized equipment makes each race/class combination a very different experience. Explore a mostly randomized underworld, fight monsters, loot treasures and uncover the many secrets lurking in the world of Ancardia.\n<br>\n<br>\nJoin a generation of gamers in playing a remastered version of this classic rogue-like!\n<br>\n<br>\nWith an overhaul of the graphics, music, new playable races and classes, over 400 monsters, tens of thousands of items, crafting, magic, religion, corruption, randomized dungeons and so much more, this reimagined version is one of the most in-depth roguelikes on the planet.\n<br>\n<br>\nSo, come join us as we return to Ancardia and choose your fate.\n<strong class=\"hmb\">\n <br>\n <br>\n ABOUT ADOM ON STEAM\n</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nADOM on Steam takes ADOM gameplay to the next level by introducing the following features (among others):\n<br>\n<ul>\n <li>\n  70+ achievements,\n  <br>\n </li>\n <li>\n  game customization features (e.g. turning corruption off, increasing treasure rates adjusting monster lethality),\n  <br>\n </li>\n <li>\n  ghost creation and exchange between players - be haunted by dead player characters and try to win their treasures,\n  <br>\n </li>\n <li>\n  story mode - save and reload your games,\n  <br>\n </li>\n <li>\n  exploration mode - use a wand of wishes to discover completely new sides of the game,\n  <br>\n </li>\n <li>\n  challenge mode - try to score highest under complex conditions in weekly challenge games,\n  <br>\n </li>\n <li>\n  shared and global highscores,\n  <br>\n </li>\n <li>\n  point-based character generation,\n  <br>\n </li>\n <li>\n  star sign selection,\n  <br>\n </li>\n <li>\n  and so much more.\n </li>\n</ul>\n<strong class=\"hmb\">\n <br>\n <br>\n THE FUTURE OF ADOM\n</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nIs ADOM a complete game? Yes, a very complete game. A multitude of endings, varied approaches to game play, thousands of starting combinations and an extensive storyline filled with endless details makes for an extremely satisfying experience that justly positions ADOM as one of the big five foundational roguelike games.\n<br>\n<br>\nIs ADOM a finished game? No. As long as there is interest in the game we will continue to evolve and enhance it. In this respect ADOM differs from many other games on Steam in the best tradition of roguelike classics: We will continue to add both UI enhancements and new content to the core game in order to make it the most complete RPG ever. Buy once, play forever!\n",

As such, they have their own takes on Hellevators.

The barrel’s built-in bar is, of course, stocked with ale.\n<br>\n<br>\nOnly in the deepest depths will you find the most powerful materials, the warmest magma, the rarest treasures, and the most dangerous conditions.\n<br>\nFiguring out the fastest and safest route down - and up again - is a chief concern, but you’ll have plenty of unique Dwarven mechanisms to help you do so.\n<br>\n<i>Hammerting</i> will feature liquid and physics mechanics for pumping lava to your hearths, brewing beer, tossing torches down shafts to light up the unknown and more.\n<strong class=\"hmb\">\n <br>\n <br>\n Modding\n</strong>\n<br>\nWant to bring your own spin to <i>Hammerting</i>? No worries, you can mod to your heart’s content!\n<br>\nYou can use the bundled SDK to create pre-packaged mods and add or replace any of the game’s assets\n<br>\nThis is not just limited to “data” assets such as textures, you can also script and write new full-blown systems in native C++\n<strong class=\"hmb\">\n <br>\n <br>\n End note\n</strong>\n<br>\nPlease wishlist the game, come join us on Discord and follow us on Twitter!\n",

With the power to both uncover and play with \"the truth\", you must decide for yourself how far you will go in the service of your country and whether the truth is sacred or ignorance is strength.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  Inducted into “The Office”--a top-secret department of the government’s Orwell security program--you’ll take on the role of an investigative agent during a time when civil unrest threatens to become a major political crisis between the Nation and neighboring country Parges.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  Reporting directly to Orwell adviser, Ampleford, you‘re tasked with uncovering the truth behind the escalating political tension, and delving deep into the lives of Raban Vhart, editor of The People’s Voice and self-proclaimed guardian of truth, his wife, Karen, and his brother, Illya, to uncover their potential involvement.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  To assist you in your task, you will be given new tools and mechanics that provide opportunities to control and impact the narrative. A new “time of day” system puts you in time-sensitive situations, making who you chose to investigate and when, more important than ever. You can also research more widely and dig deeper into citizen’s lives, gathering additional information to influence the way events are reported and perceived by the public.\n  <strong class=\"hmb\">\n   <br>\n   <br>\n   FEATURES:\n  </strong>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>\n   Investigate the agitators -\n  </strong>\n  Enter the world of Orwell and join a top-secret department of agents known as “The Office” during a time of civil unrest and political tension. Profile persons of interest by exploring web pages, social media and private communications. Make connections. Find the information you need to know.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>\n   Uncover the truth -\n  </strong>\n  Separate the stories from the facts, the propagated myths and fake news from what’s really happening. Identify the hidden agendas of all those involved and expose them.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>\n   Manipulate the information -\n  </strong>\n  Use Orwell’s upgraded toolset and the information you have uncovered to create your own version of the truth. Then use that to gain influence and control over the situation.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>\n   End the threat -\n  </strong>\n  Expose the truth.

Dispatch units, take calls and face situations caused by weather, traffic or changing seasons.

Full 3D visualization will give you the inside view of your units’ actions. Choose from over 100 000 areas, such as districts, municipalities, and tens of thousands of real cities from all over the world.\n<strong class=\"hmb\">\n <br>\n <br>\n To all units: a storm is coming…\n</strong>\n<br>\nFace the dynamic weather, based on authentic, historical data. Watch the incidents change as day or night comes, traffic increases and seasons pass. Watch out for extreme conditions that may lead to cataclysms and natural disasters. Try to tame big wildfires spreading across the map. Weather isn’t your only problem though - be careful when dealing with terrorist attacks and gang wars.\n<strong class=\"hmb\">\n <br>\n <br>\n</strong>\n<br>\n<strong class=\"hmb\">\n <br>\n <br>\n 112, what’s your emergency?\n</strong>\n<br>\nTake calls from people in various situations, needing emergency services’ help.

Follow the commands of your supervisors and see your actions affecting people you’re in charge of or those who need your help. Sometimes your mistakes will only be followed by a reprimanding e-mail, sometimes they’ll influence your own life.\n<br>\nYou can also play special scenarios in any city in the world, or make your own rules in the Free Game mode.\n<strong class=\"hmb\">\n <br>\n <br>\n We need backup!\n</strong>\n<br>\nCommand the best specialists, using technologically advanced equipment and vehicles.

        "description": "<strong>BECOME THE BABA YAGA</strong><br><strong>John Wick Hex</strong> is a fast-paced, action-oriented strategy game that makes you think and strike like John Wick, the professional hitman of the critically acclaimed film franchise. Created in close cooperation with the creative teams behind the films, John Wick Hex is fight-choreographed chess brought to life as a video game, capturing the series’ signature gun fu style while expanding its story universe. Players must make quick decisions and choose every action and attack they make, all the while considering their immediate cost and consequences.<br><br>Featuring a unique blend of strategic momentum-based combat, John Wick Hex captures the feel of the unique tactical combat from the films and blurs the line between the strategy and action video game genres. Perform well and progress in the main story mode (which features an original story created for the game) to unlock new weapons, suit options and locations. Each weapon changes up the tactics you’ll use and the manner in which you’ll play. Ammo is finite and realistically simulated, so time your reloads and make the most of weapons you scavenge on the job.<br><br>Experience an original new story set prior to the events of the films which sees John on a desperate mission to rescue Winston and Charon from a dangerous new adversary seeking his birthright. This story is brought to life by the world class voice talents of Ian McShane and Lance Reddick, reprising their iconic roles from the films, and voice acting legend Troy Baker, joining the stellar cast as the game's eponymous villain 'Hex'. John Wick Hex compliments the style of the films with a unique graphic noir art design and an original score by renowned composer Austin Wintory.",
