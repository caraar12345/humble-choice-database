## Humble Choice Database
> Please note: this just generates a JSON file of the games/extras included. It doesn't make actually claiming them any quicker!

This Python script runs through the Humble Choice pages and creates a JSON file of all the choices, starting from December 2019.

Once you've run the script, access `index.html` via a HTTP server (`python3 -m http.server` from this folder > open `http://localhost:8000`, for example!).

You'll then see this âœ¨
